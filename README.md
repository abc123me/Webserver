# Webserver
This is an HTTP-Only webserver that has PHP support, that's it!

## TODO
- Massive security overhaul
  - Fixing a bug that allows anyone to access server files
  - Adding a file blacklist 
  - Adding a file alias list (Eg. filename.html can be accessed by file)
  - Adding a folder called public which stores all public files
- Implement POST request management
